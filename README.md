# expenses-tracker-backend

Simple expenses tracker app creating for learning golang

Backend part is based on AWS Lambda and DynamoDB

Web frontend will be created later, probably in React.

Maybe I'll also try to create a mobile client in ReactNative or Swift/Kotlin separated projects and desktop version, also written in Go
